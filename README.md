# Contact Form — Task 6

This is my submission for Task 6, where I created a simple Contact Form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form validates the inputs on the client side and shows errors or a success message. No data is sent to any server — it's only a frontend demo.

## Features
- Name, Email, and Message fields
- Client-side validation using JavaScript
- Error messages shown below each field
- Success message when all inputs are valid
- Reset button to clear the fields
- All code written inside a single HTML file (as required)

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Submit empty/invalid fields to see validation errors
3. Enter valid details to see the success message

## What I Learned
- How form validation works in JavaScript
- How to show dynamic error messages
- Using `event.preventDefault()` to stop actual submission
- Building a clean and simple UI with HTML & CSS
